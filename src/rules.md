Volleyball is a popular sport played by teams of six 
players, with the objective of hitting a ball over a net 
and into the opposing team's court without the ball being 
returned. The following are the basic rules of volleyball:

1. **Serving**: A player from the serving team must serve the 
ball from behind the back boundary line, over the net and 
into the opposing team's court. If the ball lands in the 
opposing team's court or is not returned, the serving team 
earns a point.

2. **Rally**: After the ball is served, each team has three 
touches to return the ball back over the net to the other 
team. The ball cannot be touched more than once in a row by 
the same player.

3. **Scoring**: Points are awarded to the serving team if the 
ball lands in the opposing team's court, or if the opposing 
team commits a fault such as hitting the ball out of bounds 
or making an illegal touch.

4. **Rotation**: After a team wins a rally and earns a point, 
the players rotate positions clockwise, with the server 
moving to the back row.

5. **Net height**: The height of the net is different for 
men's and women's volleyball. In men's volleyball, the net 
is set at a height of 7 feet 11 5/8 inches (2.43 meters), 
while in women's volleyball, it is set at a height of 7 
feet 4 1/8 inches (2.24 meters).

6. **Timeouts**: Each team is allowed two timeouts per set, 
which last 30 seconds each.

7. **Substitutions**: Teams are allowed unlimited 
substitutions, but players can only enter the game in 
specific positions and at specific times.

These are the basic rules of volleyball, but there are also 
more detailed rules regarding ball handling, fouls, and 
violations that players and coaches should be familiar with 
to ensure fair play and a successful game.
