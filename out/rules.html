<p>Volleyball is a popular sport played by teams of six players, with the objective of hitting a ball over a net and into the opposing team’s court without the ball being returned. The following are the basic rules of volleyball:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>Serving</strong>: A player from the serving team must serve the ball from behind the back boundary line, over the net and into the opposing team’s court. If the ball lands in the opposing team’s court or is not returned, the serving team earns a point.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rally</strong>: After the ball is served, each team has three touches to return the ball back over the net to the other team. The ball cannot be touched more than once in a row by the same player.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Scoring</strong>: Points are awarded to the serving team if the ball lands in the opposing team’s court, or if the opposing team commits a fault such as hitting the ball out of bounds or making an illegal touch.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Rotation</strong>: After a team wins a rally and earns a point, the players rotate positions clockwise, with the server moving to the back row.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Net height</strong>: The height of the net is different for men’s and women’s volleyball. In men’s volleyball, the net is set at a height of 7 feet 11 5/8 inches (2.43 meters), while in women’s volleyball, it is set at a height of 7 feet 4 1/8 inches (2.24 meters).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Timeouts</strong>: Each team is allowed two timeouts per set, which last 30 seconds each.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Substitutions</strong>: Teams are allowed unlimited substitutions, but players can only enter the game in specific positions and at specific times.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are the basic rules of volleyball, but there are also more detailed rules regarding ball handling, fouls, and violations that players and coaches should be familiar with to ensure fair play and a successful game.</p>
